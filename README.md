# Pizza-Sales-Analytics

In the vibrant cities of India, a renowned company known as
"PizzaXpress" has been serving mouthwatering pizzas to its
customers for years. However, the PizzaXpress has recently
encountered challenges due to inconsistent sales figures, declining
revenue and the need to optimize their operations. To gain a
profound understanding of the factors influencing their business and
boost sales performance, we have initiated a thorough data analysis project.

1. Data Collection and Database Setup:
Started by collecting comprehensive sales data and set up a robust database in MS SQL Server to store and organize the information effectively.

2. Data Cleaning and Processing:
In the process, I enhanced data quality by standardizing the pizza sizes (e.g., L to Large, S to Regular, M to Medium, and more) for better analysis and interpretation. Additionally, I added two key columns: total_orders and order_day. total_orders was calculated using a formula to count and aggregate order instances, providing a clear picture of sales. order_day was derived from order_date to categorize orders by day of the week, aiding in trend analysis.

3. In-depth Analysis:
Dove into the data, conducting various insightful analyses such as daily and hourly trends for total orders, sales percentages by pizza category and size, total pizzas sold by category, and identifying the top and bottom sellers.

4. Excel Dashboard Creation:
Next up, designed an interactive Excel dashboard that visually presents the trends and key findings. Utilized bar, line, and pie charts, and even a funnel chart to showcase the data in an engaging and informative manner.
